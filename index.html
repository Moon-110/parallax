            <h2>About Parallax</h2>
            <p>Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance.[1] The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation[2] since the 1930s. Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics with its introduction to video games in the early 1980s. Some parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game Jump Bug (1981).[3] It used a limited form of parallax scrolling with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly, adding depth to the scenery. The following year, Moon Patrol (1982) implemented a full form of parallax scrolling, with three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the distance between them.[4] Moon Patrol is often credited with popularizing parallax scrolling.[5][6] Jungle King (1982), later called Jungle Hunt, also had parallax scrolling,[7] and was released a month after Moon Patrol in June 1982.</p>

            <h2>Layer Method</h2>
            <p>Some display systems support multiple background layers that can be scrolled independently in horizontal and vertical directions and composited on one another, simulating a multiplane camera. On such a display system, a game can produce parallax by simply changing each layer's position by a different amount in the same direction. Layers that move more quickly are perceived to be closer to the virtual camera. Layers can be placed in front of the playfield—the layer containing the objects with which the player interacts—for various reasons such as to provide increased dimension, obscure some of the action of the game, or distract the player.

            <h2>Sprite Method</h2>
            <p>Programmers may also make pseudo-layers of sprites—individually controllable moving objects drawn by hardware on top of or behind the layers—if they are available on the display system. For instance Star Force, an overhead-view vertically scrolling shooter for NES, used this for its starfield, and Final Fight for the Super NES used this technique for the layer immediately in front of the main playfield. The Amiga computer has sprites which can have any height and can be set horizontal with the copper co-processor, which makes them ideal for this purpose. Risky Woods on the Amiga uses sprites multiplexed with the copper to create an entire fullscreen parallax background layer[9] as an alternative to the system's dual playfield mode.</p>
